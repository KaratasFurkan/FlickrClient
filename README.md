# Flickr Client

* Ability to fetch and display latest public photos from the Flickr API (https://
www.flickr.com/services/api/)
* Ability to search with a set of keywords using the Flickr API
* Infinite scroll through paginated set of results
* Full screen preview when a photo is tapped

Libraries I used in this project are:

* **Glide** (to load images from url)
* **Retrofit** (to send GET request to Flickr API)
* **Recyclerview** (to display infinite scrolling list efficiently)
